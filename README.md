# weather-alert
this is a program to automate daily rain check

this will notify you when you will run this file

But if you want to get notified daily without having this file you can upload this file to a cloud code executer(https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) and set time as per your schedule.
if you want hourly data you will have to edit this program on line 27 and remove slicing part
